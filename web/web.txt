How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link?

    The internet works by utilizing computers to send requests from the user and returns from the servers which provide data.
The internet is a massive global network of computers connected to the internet which each have unique addresses. addresses
on the internet are called Internet Protocol(IP) addresses.  By having unique IP addresses, this allows the comptuers to talk
to one another. 

    When you click on a link, a request is sent by the user in a browser utilizing a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which is 
comprised of a protocol(http://), Hostname(yahoo.com), Resource(/search), and potential query arguments (?input=newsarticle).  
The request itself is sent with a method, path, protocol version, headers, and blank line.  The server then receives the 
request and produces HTML in response which is then received by the broswer. The browser will then render the HTML so that 
the user can view it, including any styling(example:CSS) or interactivity(Javascript).
